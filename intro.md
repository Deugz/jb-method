# Method


```{epigraph}

Description of what I am trying to achieve:
- Gather most of the experiments related to a certain topic to help put together the work of the different disciplines and improve our colaborative workflow

- I have decided to split the section into different experimental techniques

## Spectroscopy

```{note}

Ins√©rer grid with subdivision of EM spectrum (use different format for where I contributed with links toward experiment).

Alone we had very little to solve the great scientific puzzle. Here is a place where each of us can contribute to help us all
